## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a pretty basic one, the problems were the images and its positions, but the most troublesome part was making the rounded borders on the containers.

### Continued development

Looking forward to fix the overflow that wasnt appearing on local host, and a better way of doing the rounded borders.
